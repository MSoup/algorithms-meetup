### Graphs and Trees**

Definitions and terminology:

* [Harvard's CS50 lecture on data structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s). The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C.
* [Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity.](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs)

### Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.:

* [Playlist of videos explaining graph theory topics and algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P), by William Fiset on youtube. [Plus implementations in Java](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/tree/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory)
* [Binary Search Tree chapters](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast014.html) from Think Data Structures, code examples in Java.

## Other Tips

### Whiteboarding

For virtual interviews, keep a printed copy of these tips near your desk.
For in-person interviews, commit these to memory!

- [ ] Repeat the problem back to the interviewer using example input and output to make sure you understand the question
- [ ] State your approach in broad terms. As you do so, write out pseudo-code, function stubs, or other big landmarks in your program
- [ ] State (and write down) your assumptions
- [ ] Use good variable names
- [ ] Solve messy, refactor if you have time
- [ ] Walk your interviewer through the problem using your output. Trace your program like a debugger, writing down the values of intermediate variables as you go. Practice this on a whiteboard and on a text editor.
- [ ] Give O(n) time and space complexity
